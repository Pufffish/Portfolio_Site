    <p>
      I am currently a freshman at NJIT majoring in Human-Computer Interactions.
      I love this major because it combines computer science, design, and psychology, three fields I love and enjoy doing.
      I hope to obtain a position as a UX designer, for it is a direct way to see how my work could impact and benefit
      others in day-to-day life.
      <br><br>
      I have always loved designing and creating,
      having extensive experience with Adobe Suite and digital and traditional art.
      I also enjoy programming, where I see programs come to life.
      Languages I know include Python, Java, HTML, and CSS.
      <br><br>
      In my free time, I also like to play video games, I am learning game design and development.
      My dream would be to have my own studio and game. I also enjoy drawing and designing.
      I have done yearbook club throughout high school and newspaper club in college,
      where I get to utilize my graphic design skills.
